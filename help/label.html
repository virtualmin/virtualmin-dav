<header>Enable DAV logins?</header>

When this feature is selected, mail and FTP users within this virtual
server will be able to use a DAV client (such as Windows Network Places)
to access the <tt>/dav</tt> URL page and manage web page files. Only users
for which DAV access has been enabled will be able to login though. <p>
